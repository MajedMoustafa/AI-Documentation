# AI-Documentation

> Documentation that writes and maintains itself

## Overview

AI-Documentation is an intelligent documentation system designed to eliminate documentation rot. It automatically generates, updates, and maintains your project documentation by analyzing your codebase, pull requests, and commit history.

## The Problem

Traditional documentation faces a critical challenge: **documentation rot**. As code evolves, documentation quickly becomes outdated, leading to:
- Inaccurate API references
- Misleading implementation guides
- Wasted developer time
- Onboarding friction for new team members

## The Solution

AI-Documentation keeps your docs in sync with your code automatically, ensuring documentation is always accurate and up-to-date.

## Key Features

### 🤖 Automated Generation

- Analyzes pull requests and commits to extract meaningful changes
- Creates comprehensive API references and service documentation

### 🔄 Auto-Updates
- Detects code changes in real-time
- Updates documentation automatically when code evolves
- Maintains version history and change logs

### 💡 AI-Powered Intelligence
- **Smart Explanations**: Provides clear, contextual explanations of APIs and services
- **Outdated Content Detection**: Automatically flags documentation that no longer matches the codebase
- **Interactive Q&A**: Functions as a chatbot trained on your repository, answering developer questions instantly

### 🔍 Repository-Aware
